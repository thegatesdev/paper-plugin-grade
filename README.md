# Paper plugin template

Template code for setting up a `1.21.5` Paper plugin.

## Contents

- Bootstrapper setup
- Brigadier command setup
- Auto generate `paper-plugin.yml`
- Run Paper server with Gradle
- Build options configured with `gradle.properties`
- Dependencies configured with `libs.versions.toml`
- Build logic stuffed away in convention plugins

I use this for my personal work.
You may use it too, if you find it useful.
